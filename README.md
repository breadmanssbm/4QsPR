A huge thank you to Bard for putting together some incredible artwork to bring these jokers to life! 

This Balatro mod adds 16 new Jokers representing each of the players on the Winter 2024 4Qs PR. These Jokers are not particularly balanced as compared to the base game, but hopefully their powers are enjoyable. I am not a Lua programmer so the code is probably pretty janky  - raise an issue here if you encounter any crashes or bugs.
